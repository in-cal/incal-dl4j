This is a wrapper of [Deeplearning4J library](https://deeplearning4j.org) designed especially for time-series classification and prediction using (one-dimensional) convolutional neural networks and LSTMs.

#### Example(s)

* [Classification of walking (gait) time series](src/main/scala/examples/WalkingActivityClassificationWithCNN.scala) - classification of WISDM data set into 6 activities/categories (e.g., walking, standing, and jogging) using CNNs

#### Acknowledgement

Development of this library has been significantly supported by a one-year MJFF Grant (2018-2019):
*Scalable Machine Learning And Reservoir Computing Platform for Analyzing Temporal Data Sets in the Context of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and Biomedicine*
